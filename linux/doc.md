Description:
For this assignment, I successfully completed the tasks required to create an Azure virtual machine and establish an SSH connection to its shell. The steps I followed are summarized below:
	1.	Azure Account Creation:
	  •	Registered a new Azure account using my HAMK student email.
	  •	Activated the free trial and requested Azure for Students credits.
	2.	Virtual Machine Setup:
	  •	Created a virtual machine using Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS Gen 2 from the Azure Marketplace in my mac.
	  •	Configured the machine with the logical name format as "tux-tosh" and selected the Standard_B2ls_v2 size.
	  •	Enabled SSH traffic via a specified public IP , created authentication using an SSH key.
	3.	SSH Connection:
	  •	use terminal to paste down and successfully connected to the virtual machine using the generated SSH to VM with specified private key
	4.	Documentation:
	  •	Documented the entire process in a Markdown file, including installation steps and verification of successful SSH connection.
	  •	Created a GitHub repository for Linux assignments and uploaded the Markdown file.

The link to my GitHub repository containing the Markdown file is provided in the Moodle submission.
